# student-performance-analysis
## 📌 Project Overview

This project investigates how academic performance is influenced by socio-demographic and lifestyle factors among high school students. It is part of the Data Analysis Capstone Project for Code:You.

Using two real-world datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we compare student outcomes in Math and Portuguese language courses.  
The project explores relationships between variables such as parental education, internet access, study time, and alcohol consumption, and their impact on students' final grades.

## 📊 Datasets Used
### 1. Student Performance in Math
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **File**: `student-mat.csv`  
- **Rows**: 395  
- **Columns**: 33  
- **Qualitative Variables**: gender, school, parent's jobs, address, internet access, etc.  
- **Quantitative Variables**: age, absences, G1-G3 grades, study time, etc.

### 2. Student Performance in Portuguese
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **File**: `student-por.csv`  
- **Rows**: 649  
- **Columns**: 33  
- **Qualitative Variables**: similar to Math dataset  
- **Quantitative Variables**: same structure – includes grades, absences, age, etc.

Both datasets share many columns and can be merged for deeper analysis.
